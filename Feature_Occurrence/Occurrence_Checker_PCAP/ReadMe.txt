This is an early stage, PCAP occurrence reader
Instead of CSVs it reads straight from .pcap
It is only able to look for a few features at the moment.

It can extract straight from the pcap but,
Downside:
It is relatively slow compared to the CSV reader, and since we are already compiling .csv files, it is easier to work with them.
